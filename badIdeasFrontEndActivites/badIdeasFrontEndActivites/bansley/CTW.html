    <h2>
        <u>Mission</u>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Code the Way facilitates the collaboration of schools, companies, and nonprofits to:
        (1) Offer students advanced computer science training and real-world job experiences working on projects that
        benefit nonprofits;
        (2) Increase certified computer science teachers; and
        (3) Contribute to the technology talent base.
    </p>
    <p>
        Code the Way model includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Student access to real-world job experience – In addition to an advanced course that may earn
                post-secondary
                credits,
                students get experience working collaboratively on a project that benefits a nonprofit, culminating in a
                presentation to business leaders.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Companies are part of the solution – Companies invest in education,
                make technology more accessible to nonprofits,
                offer their employees a meaningful volunteer experience,
                and contribute to the talent pipeline.
